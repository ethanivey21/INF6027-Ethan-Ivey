Here is the code and data for the study of England's peformance at Euro 2020. The file is split into two. One file has the R code for each test.
Each test has been seperated out and clearly marked. All of the code has been commented explaining what each line does. Moreover an explanation on how to run the code is explained.
The other file contains all the data for the code. These will need to be downloaded and extracted for the R code to work effectively.

Any questions please feel free to reach out to me at: ejivey1@sheffield.ac.uk
